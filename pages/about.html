        I’m someone who believes in the power of self-awareness. When you never explore about thyself then you’re influenced by the society and starts following everything that provokes your emotions. Overwhelming or Unchanneled emotions can make you weak or vulnerable in nature. Accomplishing the <b>Body to Mind</b> & <b>Mind to Heart</b> connections that drives one’s self to understand and adhere for making clear decisions in life. </p>
       <p>
        I don’t have any role models or personalities because I don’t want to become like anyone else! It’s me someone special! I just aspire to inspire and create to thrive that satiates my soul and serves my purpose of life. Learn from everyone you meet, the books you read, and the challenges you face! Indeed, never become a copy-cat. Foster thyself and build an unstoppable force of energy that creates value in any direction of life.

        I was never started from a straight road, I have had to take the different routes that lead me to dead-ends, rugged experiences and yet I never bothered about the destiny. All in all, I focused on the learning and crafting myself rather than thinking whether I’ll reach or not in the end. I figured it out no legend in the history was a master in particular subject but they plunged into multiple streams and gained a sound knowledge to build a global perspective that feeds the curiosity, contentment and, exploration in drastic lengths. I challenged myself with different subjects to find out what is my passion? And what should I do to live at its best with fast-pacing world?</p>
      <p>
        Only passion can’t do everything! There should be a gateway that can take you where your passion can’t! I’m just building the blocks for that gateway without losing the passion of life. And being a free spirit in learning and experimenting then every project, every challenge has been an opportunity for growth and learning, shaping me into the professional I am today.

        I specialise in different subjects and areas and I'll be learning more in near future. I strongly feel learning should not come to an end or limit one’s self after sometime in life. I love solving problems or facing challenges, and that makes me to grow just not only as a professional but a mentor to the people who aspire, dream big in life like me.

        For an instance in <b>Design</b>, the notion is to create an aesthetically pleasing creative that blends with the design principles and serves its purpose for business, model or interest. Indeed, It’s a curation of proper research in all areas like Business, People, Marketing trends and Design. Fortunately, everything is present and now just knowing like What? Where? and When to use it? Is the game changing aspect in design for a designer.

        I’m not a 9-5 slave or a regular freelancer just follows as said to do! Indeed, I do provide my expertise, services and especially quality of time to create an impact that lasts longer in both personal and professional areas. I solve the challenges or problems in a way that has to be done in best case. I’m committed to myself to create value for whatever I do by maintaining effective measures in the process of doing the work.</p>
       <p>
        I have a phrase “I never tried it but I’m ready to do it now” is a go to thing for me achieving extreme level in work rather than excuse of “I don’t know, how to do it, “I start by a clear communication and end with a promised delivery that as per discussions or proposals. There won’t be any false promises or expectations or fancy terms to brighten the day, merely the focus will be on what’s needed and what has to be done precisely?
        Your growth will be the milestone in my journey.
